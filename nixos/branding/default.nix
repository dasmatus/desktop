# The boot pictures, drawn at build time from salmon.png, the logo LosOS
# boots behind (CREDITS.md), on the dark palette derisk and LosOS's WebUI
# share (mcsapi-theme's derisk-dark tokens), so replacing salmon.png
# replaces every one of them. Plain data, called by grub.nix, splash.nix and
# the installer's iso.nix:
#
#   grub/       GRUB's theme: theme.txt, the salmon, the fonts it names and
#               the highlight behind the selected entry
#   splash.bmp  the UKI's .splash, which systemd-stub centres on the screen
#               while the kernel and initrd load, between GRUB and Plymouth
#   logo.png    the salmon alone, still, for whatever wants a logo
#               (boot.plymouth.logo)
#   swim/       the salmon swimming, frame by frame, for the Plymouth theme
#               (splash.nix), which plays them while the machine starts
#
# `name` is what the pictures call the system: "LosOS Desktop", or on the
# installer's medium "LosOS Desktop installer".

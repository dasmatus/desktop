# pm stays the system manager. This image comes from nixpkgs, but software a
# user builds or runs on the machine goes through pm: signed recipes built into
# .cpkg archives, their entrypoints run in pm's sandbox, and pmd as its worker.
#
# Nothing extra is needed for that sandbox. It is unprivileged user namespaces
# plus landlock, both of which NixOS's kernel allows by default.
#
# pm also administers the machine, as a user of its own. `pm system` asks
# `pmd --system`, which runs as `pm` and asks polkit about each caller, and an
# administrator authenticates as themselves before pm starts, stops or
# restarts a unit or updates the system. That is all it does: it runs no
# command as root, which is why sudo, su and run0 are gone and not replaced
# (accounts.nix). docs/pm.md has the commands.

# pm's plugins are shipped under /run/current-system/sw/share/pm/plugins and
# not installed into anyone's config: pm runs a plugin only when it is signed
# by a key its user trusts, and that trust is the user's to give. Where a user
# runs Home Manager, the flake's homeModules.pm (nixos/home/pm.nix) installs
# and signs them from their own configuration.

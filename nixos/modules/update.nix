# Updates replace; they do not patch.
#
# systemd-sysupdate keeps two of each thing it manages: two UKIs on the ESP,
# two /usr slots, two verity hash trees. An update downloads the new version
# into whichever slot is not booted and touches neither the running system
# nor /home. There is no nixos-rebuild here and no Nix on the machine to run
# one with.
#
# Rollback needs no failure detection. GRUB offers the newest UKI; a UKI
# installed by sysupdate carries a boot counter in its file name, which GRUB
# counts down in grubenv; losos-grub-bless settles the name once
# boot-complete.target is reached; an entry that never gets blessed runs out
# of tries and GRUB falls back to the older one by itself (grub.nix). The
# older UKI's usrhash still names the older /usr, which is still there. A
# BIOS PC boots the same way, from the kernel and initrd bios.nix's
# transfers put beside each UKI.
